<title>He will not leave me until.... - Alex Blog</title><meta name=description content="Most times, I tend to focus on how much I need to be devoted to Jesus. And no doubt, this is very important. However, I came across a verse again today that I always love to read because it reminds me that Jesus is also devoted to me.
When Jacob was fleeing from his brother Esau, The Lord appeared to Jacob, and after making many promises to him The Lord concludes by saying: &ldquo;Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go&mldr; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you&rdquo; [Genesis 28:15].">
