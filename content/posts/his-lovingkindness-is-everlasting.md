> _We lie in shame and in dishonor, for we and our fathers have sinned from childhood against the Lord our God; we have not obeyed him. O Israel, if you will truly return to me and absolutely discard your idols, and if you will swear by me alone, the living God, and begin to live good, honest, clean lives, then you will be a testimony to the nations of the world, and they will come to me and glorify my name._

> - Jeremiah 3:25 - 4:2 (TLB)

The verses above were written at a time when the Israelites (Judah) were in a very backslidden state, to the point where God was ready to send them on exile. Yet, even in the saddened state, The Lord was still offering them an opportunity to repent. He promised them that if only they would repent and live godly lives, not only would he not punish them, but He will still be able to use them as a testimony to those around them and use them to draw others to Himself and to glorify his name.

This is a great encouragement to me because I also have failed God in the past and dishonored His name publicly. These passage assures me that if only I am willing to humble myself, repent sincerely, learn from my mistakes and failures, and begin to walk aright, then God can still use my life as a testimony even to those amongst whom I have been a poor witness to in the past.

Praise God for His lovingkindness is everlasting!
