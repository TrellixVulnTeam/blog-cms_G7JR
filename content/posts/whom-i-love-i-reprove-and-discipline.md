"_Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent._" ‭‭Rev ‭3:19‬

At my job, we recently had performance reviews and I was thinking about how anxious free the process was for me. This was because on several occasions within the past nine months my manager and I had discussed the company's expectations for my role, what areas I was doing well, and what I needed to improve on. As a result, when the official review process began, I had already checked all the right boxes and I knew what to expect. I imagine how disappointed I would have been if I never got any feedback from my manager until it was time for official reviews, and then I was told that I hadn't been meeting performance expectations and so would be passed over for a promotion.

How much more I want to be thankful that as a child of God I have the great privilege of being disciplined by Him here on earth so that I don't have any surprises on the day I stand before the judgment seat of Christ. The people of this world don't have such a privilege. The verse above reminded me that the goal of God's discipline is to present me blameless on that day. Therefore, I want to gladly yield to and accept all of God's discipline here on earth by being quick to repent; knowing that the process is working for me a much more eternal and exceeding weight of glory. Amen!

_Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal._

2 Cor 4:16-18
