...so that *he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together*. For in this case the saying is true, 'One sows and another reaps.' I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored and you have entered into their labor." - John 4:38

I recently had some opportunity to share the gospel with a few people close to me. After sharing, I was hoping and praying for a noteworthy response from them, however, I got only a somewhat casual response. I was initially tempted to be discouraged but the passage above helped me realize that many times a soul that is won to Christ (reaping) is preceded by a period of sowing. Perhaps the _sudden_ revival that happened in Samaria probably wasn't so sudden after all, but involved others sowing little seeds in the life of the Samaritan woman and others over a period of time. I also think of John the baptist who spent months preparing people for the ministry of Jesus. In addition, I was challenged not to be like the man who didn't have faith that Jesus could set a loved one from the bonds of the devil (Mark 9:22-24).

Thus, I desire to consistently share the gospel and my testimony as often as I have the opportunity and am led to, even if I don't see any immediate fruit. May we trust God that all good seeds we sow in the lives of others, accompanied with prayers, will not be in vain. Amen!
