Recently, I was reading 2 Tim 4:16 and began to meditate on all the sufferings Paul had to God through in life, despite His total devotion to Jesus and the fact that all his life's work was to further God's kingdom on earth.

I was thinking about why God permits His Children, even those who are faithful, to go through many trials. Two reasons I was already familiar with were (i) For God to purify us and mature us in faith, and (ii) So we are able to strengthen others in future who go through similar trials.

However, I God opened my eyes to see a third reason and that is so we are given the opportunity to pass through many things similar to what Jesus passed through and remain faithful during the process (1 Pet 1:6-7). In this way, we are able to fellowship with Jesus not just His power, but also His sufferings (Phil 3:10-11). I have come to see that when the bible talks about we being conformed to the image of Christ, we do so not simply ideologically, but experientially by going through the same things He went through including His trials. Paul longed so much to become like Jesus, and perhaps, that was one of the reasons why he had to suffer a lot, just as Jesus did.

This is a relief for me knowing that even when I face trials in the future. Even if I don't seem to be able to understand why God is allowing it or what he wants to achieve through it, I can be rest assured that if not for any other reason, it is so that I can fellowship with Christ even in His sufferings and become more like Him, which is the best blessing I can ever have.

'Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. ' - JAMES 1:12

May the Lord help us to be faithful to Christ in every circumstance we face in life. Amen!
