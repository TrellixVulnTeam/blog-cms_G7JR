This morning I was reminded of someone who caused me a lot of harm a few years ago, and I was tempted to think unkindly of that person. However, The Lord reminded me of the instruction to love even my enemies. He also reminded me of all the good He has produced out of that same. This reminder produced genuine love in my heart. I also pictured an enemy writing a million dollar check in my name. Even if I knew such a person didn't like me and had ill feelings towards me, it would be very difficult to for me to hate them. Praise God who causes even our enemies to write million dollar checks for us!!
