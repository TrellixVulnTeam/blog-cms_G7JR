"You will seek *Me* and find *Me* when you search for *Me* with all your heart." Jer 29:13

Recently, I had a conversation with an Elder in my church (NCCF) about the best way I could be a blessing to the church. He said the primary way is to prophesy during our weekly bible studies. I remember going back home and feeling a need to spend more quality time with God in order to always have a word to bless people with during our meetings. However, I felt God strongly rebuke me about this attitude. He showed me how I was subtly making my relationship with Him a means to some other thing I desired rather than seeking Him purely out of my love for Him.

Hence, I believe if I am to truly seek the Lord with all my heart I must do so primarily because of who He is and not because of any other thing He can give to me; even though He has promised to reward me with other gifts, including prophecy.

This short article from AW Tozer has been of great blessing to me regarding this issue. One of the profound lines there says.

"Whoever seeks other objects and not God is on his own; he may obtain those objects if he is able, but he will never have God"
