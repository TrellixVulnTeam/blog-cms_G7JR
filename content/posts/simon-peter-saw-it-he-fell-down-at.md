"When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!" For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken;" Luke 5:8-9

I have always been intrigued by Peter's response to Jesus' miracle in this portion of scripture. At first glance, Peter's response doesn't make sense to me. Rather than jubilating that Jesus considered him special enough to use his boat to teach and also bless his career with such a great catch, why did he respond as though Jesus had just outlined all his secret transgressions? I believe Peter reacted this way because receiving such abundant kindness from Christ broke his heart, perhaps more than any convicting sermon would have. I believe this was because He felt so unworthy to receive such a blessing from Christ because unlike Paul he couldn't say "regarding the law, I was blameless".

I want to have the same attitude, both now and in the future, whenever I remember all the ways the Lord has blessed me. I never want to come to a point in my life when I think my "faithfulness" makes me worthy to receive His love and kindness. I also want this recognition of my unworthiness to receive any of God's blessings to drive me to count everything as loss and follow Him wholeheartedly just as Peter "forsook all and followed Him" immediately after this encounter (v11).

"And so, dear brothers, I plead with you to give your bodies to God. Let them be a living sacrifice, holy--the kind he can accept. *When you think of what he has done for you, is this too much to ask?*" Rom 12:1 (Living Bible)

"So you too, when you have done everything that was assigned and commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy servants [*undeserving of praise or a reward*, for we have not gone beyond our obligation]; we have merely done what we ought to do.' " Luke‬ ‭17:10‬ ‭AMP‬‬
