Many times when I have perceived God would have me die to self in a certain area but I was afraid that if I resisted my human instinct, I would end up bottling many things within and that this would eventually lead to frustration, discouragement and being depressed.

In those times God has reminded me that I cannot consistently deny self and go the way of the cross except I trust Him to always give me more of His divine nature so that I am able to live in constant joy, peace, and love regardless of any sacrifice I make for Him.

"For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh."

‭‭2 Corinthians‬ ‭4:11‬
