"There is a lad here who has _five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many people_?" John‬ ‭6:9‬

Sometimes I am tempted to doubt how much of a blessing I can be to the body of Christ based on how few natural gifts I have. However, I have been greatly encouraged by the verse above. The quantity of food the lad possessed had absolutely no bearing on whether Jesus would be able to use it to feed 5000 people or not. Fifty loaves would have been just as useless as five without Jesus and half a loaf would have been just as useful as five in the hands of Jesus.

In the same way, the number of natural gifts I have has no bearing on how much God can use me to bless others in His kingdom. The important question is whether I have brought ALL I have to Him, just as the lad did or if I am still withholding some things, even if they seem insignificant. Am I also allowing Him to break me in all areas (whether large or small) or If I am still trying to protect some aspect of my self-life from harm.

...God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed. 2 Cor 9:7-8
