Thank you everyone for all the encouragement you all have shared in this group over the past couple of years. It's been so awesome being a part of this group, both in-person and on WhatsApp. I still remember the first time I came to a youth conference in Loveland just a few days after coming to the US. I was welcomed wholeheartedly and always looked forward to similar times of fellowship while schooling in Kentucky.

Even as I say goodbye to this group since I am now married, I wanted to share something that encouraged me earlier this year. In 1 Tim 1:12, it says that The Lord first accessed Paul and found Him to be a faithful man before to be a faithful and trustworthy person which was why gave Him special and precious responsibility. There are several phases in Paul's life before becoming an Apostle for which the Bible gives little insight. We know very little of all he did in Arabia for 3 years, or the several years in Tarsus before going to the Church in Antioch, but 1 Tim 1:12 tells me all I need to know. He was faithful!

Although God oftentimes may not reveal beforehand the times and seasons of our life (Acts 1:7) one thing we can always strive for is to be faithful in whatever phase of life He has currently placed us; whether it be singleness or marriage, a little role in His body, or a small gift we can use to bless others. We can live faithfully knowing that in His perfect timing He will take us into the next phase of His plan for us.

Love you all!
