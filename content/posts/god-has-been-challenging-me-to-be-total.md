Recently, God has been challenging me to be a total disciple who loves nothing of this world and is totally devoted to Him. Therefore,I want to judge myself daily to see whether I am being totally devoted or have begun allowing the activities and cares of the day to distract me.

I also noticed that after the Lord began impressing this on my heart, the Devil sought to take my mind away from a simple and pure devotion to Christ, by bringing several temptations my way with the hope that if I fell short in any of them, I would become discouraged and distracted from this devotion.

And so I have come to see, that just as Eve was led astray (2 Cor 11:3) by focusing on the tree of good and evil, I can also be led astray by focusing on my spiritual victories (good) and/or failures (evil) during the day rather than focusing on the state of my heart and my devotion to Christ throughout the day.

2 Chronicles 16:10 says "Let the heart of those who seek the Lord be glad." It was good to see that it does not say "those who are perfect", or "those who do righteous deeds", but those who seek the Lord. So as long as I am constantly seeking the Lord with all my heart, I should never be discouraged even if I fall into temptation, but rather I should simply confess and repent, knowing that the Lord will assuredly give me victory as long as I remain a total/wholehearted disciple.
