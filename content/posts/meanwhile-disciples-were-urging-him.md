**_"Meanwhile the disciples were urging Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat." Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work. Do you not say, 'There are yet four months, and then comes the harvest'? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look on the fields, that they are white for harvest."_ [John‬ ‭4:31, 34-35‬]**

In the passage above I see how Jesus' disciples were so focused on their need for food that they were clueless about the revival that God wanted to bring about in Samaria. I find that for me also, it is so easy to be totally engrossed in all the tasks I need to get done that I can spend the whole day without thinking much about God except in the morning or at night.

However, these verses often challenge me to never be so focused on whatever task is _on ground_ that I don't hear the voice of the Holy Spirit telling me to lift up my head and see what God wants to do in that current situation. Perhaps, He wants me to start a conversation and look for an opportunity to share my faith with someone while on a walk; or call/text a brother to check on them and encourage them or even ask Him for help with a difficult task so that I don't waste hours on it. I pray that The Lord will teach us to always sit with Him in Heaven and have our hearts fixed on the things above. Amen

**_Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth_ ‭[Colossians‬ ‭3:1-2‬]**
