I am thankful to the Lord for the blessing of being a member of a Christ-centered local church where the bible is taught consistently, week after week, in an authoritative and practical manner. I have also had the privilege of spending the majority of the past 11 years listening to sound and very balanced teaching on how to live the new Covenant life just as Jesus intended. Consequently, during most Sunday and mid-week meetings, the likelihood of hearing teachings that I haven't heard before, in one form or another, is very slim. Despite this though, I am always blessed by each meeting and constantly look forward to them. This got me thinking about what it is that I look forward to in each meeting. The answer that came to mind is Faith. Each time I attend a meeting, I come out feeling strengthened in faith, even when I don't remember many details about what was shared. Thus it was a good reminder for me to spend some time meditating about what the bible has to say about the place of faith in a Christian's life. Below are some of my thoughts.

Faith is a central requirement for anyone to come to Christ. Before I became a Christian, I had to first believe that God exists, that according to God's law I had committed numerous crimes against Him and fellow humans right from childhood. I also had to acknowledge that the only way for me to be saved from the addiction to and penalty of such crimes was to repent, receive the only pardon God provided in the person of Jesus Christ, and believe that Jesus could truly save me from all those habits so ingrained into every human.

> "This Good News tells us that God makes us ready for heaven--makes us right in God's sight--when we put our faith and trust in Christ to save us. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith.[d] As the Scripture says it, 'The man who finds life will find it through trusting God.'"- Romans 1:17 (TLB)

But faith wasn't only important for me at the start of my Christian journey. Romans 1:17 tells us that we need faith up until the end of our lives. at the moment a person accepts salvation through Christ. Faith is central throughout a Christian's life. I must continue to trust in God day after day to take care of me, to provide all my needs, to help me overcome selfish attitudes, proud thoughts, unforgiving tendencies, worry, fear of the future, just to name a few. That is the only way for me to rename righteous in His sight, even after I have accepted Jesus into my life. Such trust in Him is what gives me the confidence to obey Him in many areas, even when it seems foolish to regular people and self-sabotaging. It is what allows me to rejoice always even when things are not going as planned because He has promised to make everything work together for my good. "Without faith, it is impossible to please God" (Hebrews 11:6). Regardless of how accurate and complete a teaching I hear or store in my brain for years, except I have faith it would be completely useless to me. And the moment I stop trusting in God's word and promises, then it is only a matter of time before I return to my old way of life that hurt God and hurt those around me also.

> Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they [the Israelites in the wilderness] also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard. - Hebrews 4:1-2

Unfortunately, faith is so easy to lose, especially we live in a world where most of what we hear and see is contrary to what we hear and see in God's word. Also, our human nature is contrary to the ways of God. Any Christian who has gone through a difficult circumstance knows how easy it is to believe one moment that God is in control and has their best interest at heart, and in the next moment becomes discouraged because the situation seems hopeless. The book of Hebrews tells us that it takes just 24 hours for unbelief to creep into a heart that was previously full of faith.

> "Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God. But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called "Today," so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin." - Hebrews 3:12-13

This is why we believers are instructed to seek to encourage each other frequently so that we maintain and increase our faith in God each day. This instruction is most easily practiced in between husbands, wives, and children in the home, and then fellow believers within a local church. Paul the Apostle knew how important and critical the battle to sustain a continually increasing faith was, hence in 1 Timothy 6:12 He admonishes Timothy to "fight the good fight of faith". And at the end of Paul's life he could boldly proclaim:

> "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day" - 2 Timothy 4:7-8

As we see the last days approaching, with so much volatility in a world and system we had earlier been accustomed to running smoothly, with fears of plagues, wars becoming more frequent, it is important, now more than ever not to put our trust in the world's system but in God and His system. We must guard jealously the faith that has been written in our hearts so far and seek more than ever before to grow in our faith in Jesus so that we can remain faithful till the end.

> "Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised. For yet in a very little while , He who is coming will come, and will not delay. But My righteous one shall live by faith; And if he shrinks back, My soul has no pleasure in him. But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul." - Hebrews 10:35-39

May the Lord find abundant faith in His people when He returns Amen!
