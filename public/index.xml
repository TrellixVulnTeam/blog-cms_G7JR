      <description>I was reading recently reading Matt 26:30 where it says that Jesus sang a hymn. This is the only time in Jesus&#39; life where it says He sang a hymn. As someone who isn&amp;rsquo;t great at singing, I was curious about how good a singer Jesus would have been. However, this led me to ask a bigger question: &amp;ldquo;How talented/skilled was Jesus in the day-to-day activities he had to engage in on it?</description>
